Some models are physical objects, for instance, a toy model which may be assembled, and may even be made to work like the object it represents. Whereas, a conceptual model is a model made of the composition of concepts, that thus exists only in the mind. Conceptual models are used to help us know, understand, or simulate the subject matter they represent."

    "> In the broadest sense, models are for learning about the world (in our case, the climate) and the learning takes place in the contruction and the manipulation of the model, as anyone who has watched a child build idealised houses or spaceships with Lego, or built with it themselves, will know.  Climate models are, likewise, idealised representations of a complicated and complex reality through which our understanding of the climate has significantly expanded. All models involve some ignoring, distoring and approximating, but gradually they allow us to build understanding of the system being modelled. A child's Lego construction typically contains the essential elements of the real objects, improves with attention to detail, helps them understand the real world, but is never confused with the real thing."
