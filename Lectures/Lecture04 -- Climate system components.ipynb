    "\n",
    "From the IPCC AR5 report:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Climate System:** “The climate system is the highly complex system consisting of five major components: the atmosphere, the hydrosphere, the cryosphere, the lithosphere and the biosphere, and the interactions between them. The climate system evolves in time under the influence of its own internal dynamics and because of external forcings such as volcanic eruptions, solar variations and anthropogenic forcings such as the changing composition of the atmosphere and land use change.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Which begs some further definitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Atmosphere**: \n",
    ">The gaseous envelope surrounding the Earth. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hydrosphere**:\n",
    ">The component of the climate system comprising liquid surface and subterranean water, such as oceans, seas, rivers, lakes, underground water, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Biosphere** (terrestrial and marine):\n",
    "> The part of the Earth system comprising all ecosystems and living organisms… including derived dead organic matter, such as litter, soil organic matter and oceanic detritus. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cryosphere**:\n",
    "> All regions on and beneath the surface of the Earth and ocean where water is in solid form, including sea ice, lake ice, river ice, snow cover, glaciers and ice sheets, and frozen ground (which includes permafrost). \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lithosphere**: \n",
    "> The upper layer of the solid Earth, both continental and oceanic, which comprises all crustal rocks and the cold, mainly elastic part of the uppermost mantle. \n",
    "\n",
    "###Let’s think about WHY we should want to include all these “spheres” into our models.\n",

    ">Figure 1.1 | Main drivers of climate change. The radiative balance between incoming solar shortwave radiation (SWR) and outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) is influenced by global climate ‘drivers’. Natural fluctuations in solar output (solar cycles) can cause changes in the energy balance (through fluctuations in the amount of incoming SWR) (Section 2.3). Human activity changes the emissions of gases and aerosols, which are involved in atmospheric chemical reactions, resulting in modified O3 and aerosol amounts (Section 2.2). O3 and aerosol particles absorb, scatter and reflect SWR, changing the energy balance. Some aerosols act as cloud condensation nuclei modifying the properties of cloud droplets and possibly affecting precipitation (Section 7.4). Because cloud interactions with SWR and LWR are large, small changes in the properties of clouds have important implications for the radiative budget (Section 7.4). Anthropogenic changes in GHGs (e.g., CO2, CH4, N2O, O3, CFCs) and large aerosols (>2.5 μm in size) modify the amount of outgoing LWR by absorbing outgoing LWR and re-emitting less energy at a lower temperature (Section 2.2). Surface albedo is changed by changes in vegetation or land surface properties, snow or ice cover and ocean colour (Section 2.3). These changes are driven by natural seasonal and diurnal changes (e.g., snow cover), as well as human influence (e.g., changes in vegetation types) (Forster et al., 2007)."

    "____________\n",
    "\n",
    "Best to discuss this with a specific example: **poleward heat transport**\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that the atmosphere moves a lot of energy from warm low latitudes to cold high latitudes – about 5 PW = 10$^{15}$ W actually. This transport of energy mainly occurs in transient weather systems (cyclones and anticyclones), in which warm, moist air tends to move poleward and cold, dry air tends to move equatorward.\n",
    "(we will look at this more careful later in the semester)\n",
    "\n",
    "Just about every climate model needs to account for this transport and its effects on the energy budgets in any climate model (unless we are dealing ONLY with global averages). \n",
    "\n",
    "So how can we do it?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameterization:\n",
    "Represent the net effect of many weather systems with an empirical relationship, such as *diffusion down mean temperature gradient*\n",
    "\n",
    "Say $T(y)$ is zonally averaged temperature, $y$ is latitude\n",
    "\n",
    "Transport = $K~dT/dy$\n",
    "\n",
    "Use observed transport to choose an appropriate value for $K$\n",
    "\n",
    "-\tPro: simple to implement, easy to understand the result\n",
    "-\tCon: how might the value of $K$ change with climate change? We have no way of knowing, and have to make assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simulation:\n",
    "Solve the time-dependent equations of motion on a grid of sufficient spatial resolution to represent the growth and decay of synoptic-scale weather systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "-\tPro: model is based on real physical principles (Newton’s laws of motion, conservation of mass and energy). It is therefore more likely to remain valid under changing climate conditions.\n",
    "-\tCon: requires lots of computer resources. Must simulate the weather even though we really just want the climate (statistics of weather!) \n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially a simulation involves representing (at least some aspects of) the underlying rules that govern the process. There is **a chain of causality linking input to output**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameterization involves **making assumptions about the statistical properties of the process** – so we can calculate some relevant statistical properties of the output given the input, without needing to explicitly model the actual events. \n"

    "\n",
    "###What is it?\n",
    "\n",
    "- CESM is one of a handful of complex coupled GCMs that are used as part of the IPCC process.\n",
    "- Developed and maintained at NCAR (Boulder CO) by a group of climate scientists and software engineers.\n",
    "- “Community” refers to the fact that the code is open-source, with new pieces contributed by a wide variety of users. \n",
    "\n",
    "I use CESM in my own research. We are going to be using CESM in this course. Everyone should visit the website and learn about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "http://www2.cesm.ucar.edu\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key components of CESM:  (or any equivalent modern GCM)\n",
    " \n",
    " - Atmospheric model, AGCM\n",
    " - Ocean model, OGCM\n",
    " - Land surface model\n",
    " - Sea ice model\n",
    "\n",
    "The software is somewhat modular, so different submodels can be combined together depending on the nature of the scientific problem at hand and the available computer power.\n",
    "\n",
    "E.g. we can run the model in “atmosphere-only” mode. Surface conditions over land and ocean will be prescribed from observations.\n",
    "**It is difficult to learn much about climate change this way.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the **surface temperature can’t change in response to energy imbalance!**\n",
    "\n",
    "i.e. it’s not a climate model, according to our working definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say we want to use our model to estimate equilibrium climate sensitivity.\n",
    "Recall $\\Delta T_{2\\times CO_2}$ is the warming we get from doubling atmospheric CO2, once the planetary energy budget has adjusted back to equilibrium.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this class we will mostly work with the so-called **slab ocean model**.\n",
    "\n",
    "You got introduced to this model in the homework exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key is that we **allow the sea surface temperature to change**, but we fix (prescribe) the net effect of ocean currents on the transport of energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do this? \n",
    "\n",
    "Because it takes thousands of years for the full ocean model to come into equilibrium!\n",
    "\n",
    "Why should we believe the results of the slab ocean model?\n",
    "\n",
    "We shouldn’t! \n",
    "\n",
    "But experience with coupled models (meaning interactive ocean circulation) has shown that the circulation does not change radically under $2\\times CO_2$. \n",
    "\n",
