    "____________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s go back to the concept of the **planetary energy budget**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C \\frac{d T_s}{dt} = F_{TOA} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{TOA} = (1-\\alpha) Q - \\sigma T_e^4$$\n",
    "\n",
    "is the **net downward energy flux** at the top of the atmosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "So for example when the planet is in equilibrium, we have $d/dt = 0$, or solar energy in = longwave emissions out\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s imagine we force the climate to change by adding some extra energy to the system, perhaps due to an increase in greenhouse gases, or a decrease in reflective aerosols. Call this extra energy a **radiative forcing**, denoted by $R$ in W m$^{-2}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The climate change will be governed by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C \\frac{d \\Delta T_s}{dt} = R + \\Delta F_{TOA}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\Delta T_s$ is the change in global mean surface temperature. This budget accounts for two kinds of changes to $T_s$:\n",
    "\n",
    "- due to the radiative forcing: $R$\n",
    "- due to resulting changes in radiative processes (internal to the climate system): $\\Delta F_{TOA}$\n",
    "\n",
    "### The feedback factor: a linearization of the perturbation energy budget\n",
    "\n",
    "The **key assumption** in climate feedback analysis is that *changes in radiative flux are proportional to surface temperature changes*:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Delta F_{TOA} = \\lambda \\Delta T_s $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\lambda$ is a constant of proportionality, with units of W m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, we are assuming that the changes are sufficiently small that we can linearize the budget about the equilibrium state (as we did explicitly in our previous analysis of the zero-dimensional EBM).\n",

    "A key question for which we need climate models is this: \n",
    "\n",
    "*How much warming do we expect for a given radiative forcing?* \n",
    "\n",
    "Or more explicitly, how much warming if we double atmospheric CO$_2$ concentration (which it turns out produces a radiative forcing of roughly 4 W m$^{-2}$, as we will see later).\n",
    "\n",
    "Given sufficient time, the system will reach its new equilibrium temperature, at which point\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{d \\Delta T_s}{dt} = 0$$\n",

    "\n",
    "We have defined things here such that **$\\lambda > 0$ for a positive feedback, $\\lambda < 0$ for a negative feedback**. That’s convenient!\n",

    "\n",
    "Another thing to note: we can decompose the total climate feedback into **additive components** due to different processes:\n",

    "$$ \\lambda = \\lambda_0 + \\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 + ... = \\sum_{i=0}^n \\lambda_i$$\n",

    "\n",
    "### What does this mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "It means that, for every W m$^{-2}$ of excess energy we put into our system, our model predicts that the surface temperature must increase by $-1/ \\lambda = 0.3$ K in order to re-establish planetary energy balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model only represents a **single feedback process**: the increase in longwave emission to space with surface warming.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Every climate model has a Planck feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "The Planck feedback is the most basic and universal climate feedback, and is present in every climate model. It is simply an expression of the fact that a warm planet radiates more to space than a cold planet.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we will see, our estimate of $\\lambda_0 = -3.3 ~\\text{W} ~\\text{m}^{-2} ~\\text{K}^{-1} $ is essentially the same as the Planck feedback diagnosed from complex GCMs. Unlike our simple zero-dimensional model, however, most other climate models (and the real climate system) have other radiative processes, such that $\\lambda \\ne \\lambda_0$."
