    "\n",
    "This document uses the interactive [`IPython notebook`](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) format (now also called [`Jupyter`](https://jupyter.org)). The notes can be accessed in several different ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The interactive notebooks are hosted on `github` at https://github.com/brian-rose/ClimateModeling_courseware\n",
    "- The latest versions can be viewed as static web pages [rendered on nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/brian-rose/ClimateModeling_courseware/blob/master/index.ipynb)\n",
    "- A complete snapshot of the notes as of May 2015 (end of spring semester) are [available on Brian's website](http://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/brose/classes/ATM623_Spring2015/Notes/index.html).\n",

    "In lecture we defined a zero-dimensional energy balance model for the global mean surface temperature $T$ as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C  \\frac{dT}{dt} =(1-Î±)Q- OLR(T)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$OLR= \\sigma (\\beta T)^4$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where we defined these terms:\n",
    "- $C = 4\\times 10^8$ J m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ is a heat capacity for the atmosphere-ocean column\n",
    "- $\\alpha$ is the global mean planetary albedo\n",
    "- $\\sigma = 5.67 \\times 10^{-8}$ W m$^{-2}$ K$^{-4}$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant\n",
    "- $\\beta=0.885$ is our parameter for the proportionality between surface temperature and emission temperature\n",
    "- $Q = 341.3$ W m$^{-2}$ is the global-mean incoming solar radiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, we will introduce a new physical process into our model by letting the planetary albedo depend on temperature. The idea is that a warmer planet has less ice and snow at the surface, and thus a lower planetary albedo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Represent the ice-albedo feedback through the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\alpha(T) = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ccc}\n",
    "\\alpha_i &   & T \\le T_i \\\\\n",
    "\\alpha_o + (\\alpha_i-\\alpha_o) \\frac{(T-T_o)^2}{(T_i-T_o)^2} &   & T_i < T < T_o \\\\\n",
    "\\alpha_o &   & T \\ge T_o \\end{array} \\right\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with the following parameter values:\n",
    "- $\\alpha_o = 0.289$ is the albedo of a warm, ice-free planet\n",
    "- $\\alpha_i = 0.7$ is the albedo of a very cold, completely ice-covered planet\n",
    "- $T_o = 293$ K is the threshold temperature above which our model assumes the planet is ice-free\n",
    "- $T_i = 260$ K is the threshold temperature below which our model assumes the planet is completely ice covered. \n",
    "\n",
    "For intermediate temperature, this formula gives a smooth variation in albedo with global mean temperature. It is tuned to reproduce the observed albedo $\\alpha = 0.299$ for $T = 288$ K. "
