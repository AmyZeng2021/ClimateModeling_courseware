    "### About these notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "This document uses the interactive [`IPython notebook`](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) format (now also called [`Jupyter`](https://jupyter.org)). The notes can be accessed in several different ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The interactive notebooks are hosted on `github` at https://github.com/brian-rose/ClimateModeling_courseware\n",
    "- The latest versions can be viewed as static web pages [rendered on nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/brian-rose/ClimateModeling_courseware/blob/master/index.ipynb)\n",
    "- A complete snapshot of the notes as of May 2015 (end of spring semester) are [available on Brian's website](http://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/brose/classes/ATM623_Spring2015/Notes/index.html).\n",

    "In this assignment you will extend the 2-layer leaky greenhouse (grey radiation) model we analyzed in class to a much larger number of layers, which would be very tedious to try to solve without a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The $N$-layer grey gas atmosphere\n",
    "\n",
    "- Divide the atmosphere up into $N$ **equal mass** layers.\n",
    "- Assume the following:\n",
    "    - The surface emits as a blackbody, $\\sigma T_s^4$\n",
    "    - Each layer emits $\\epsilon \\sigma T^4$\n",
    "    - Each layer absorbs a fraction $\\epsilon$ of the incident longwave radiation\n",
    "    - In other words, the atmosphere behaves as a grey gas.\n",
    "    - $\\epsilon$ is the same in every layer (absorbers are well-mixed).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your assigment\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Write Python code to calculate the OLR** given $\\epsilon$, $T_s$, and the temperature in each atmospheric layer. Your code should:\n",
    "    - be general enough to work for arbitrary $N$\n",
    "    - calculate the contributions to OLR from the surface and each $N$ atmospheric layer\n",
    "2. Check your code: set $T = T_s$ in every layer. **Verify that your code produces $OLR = \\sigma T_s^4$**.\n",
    "3. Use **observed global, annual mean temperatures** to tune your model:\n",
    "    - Use the NCEP reanalysis long-term-mean air temperature data, following the previous homework. \n",
    "    - Use a sufficient number of layers in your model to get good resolution of the vertical structure. Try $N=30$.\n",
    "    - Use the data to set the temperatures in your model. You may need to do some interpolation between pressure levels.\n",
    "4. **Determine the value of your parameter $\\epsilon$ ** for which your code produces $OLR = 239$ W m$^{-2}$ given the observed temperatures.\n",
    "5. Using your tuned value of $\\epsilon$ and the observed temperatures, **calculate and plot the contributions from each layer (and the surface) to the OLR.**\n",
    "6. Now use your code to calculate the **radiative forcing** associated with a **1% increase in $\\epsilon$ **.\n",
    "7. Plot the **changes** in the contributions to OLR from each layer (and the surface).\n",
    "8. As usual, write up your answers (including text, code and figures) in a new IPython notebook that runs cleanly from start to finish. Save your notebook as `[your last name].ipynb`.\n",
    "9. Submit your answers by email before class on **Tuesday February 24**."
