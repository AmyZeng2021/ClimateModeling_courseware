    "\n",
    "Although the causes of the ice ages have been discussed for over 150 years, there are still many unsolved problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Go back and look at the timeseries of global ice volume we showed in Section 1 of the [notes on Orbital variations](../Lectures/Lecture13 -- Orbital variations.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "The most recent glaciations (the \"Late Pleistocene\") have been large in amplitude and occur on a roughly 100 kyr timescale. The earlier glaciations were smaller in magnitude and occurred on shorter 40 kyr timescales -- apparently in sync with obliquity variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "One very big outstanding question is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why did the dominant frequency for the ice ages change from 40 kyr to 100 kyr roughly 800 kyr ago?**\n",
    "\n",
    "We are not going to answer that here. There is, however, a very nice clear explanation for the obliquity-pacing of the Early Pleistocene.\n",
    "\n",

This is the integrated summer insolation above the intensity threshold divided by the number of seconds during which the insolation threshold is exceeded. (Preferably plot this on the same graph as the number of days to reproduce Fig. 2A completely)."
