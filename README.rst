About 
--------------
ATM 623 Climate Modeling
is an advanced graduate course on climate dynamics and climate modeling. The focus of the course is on the hands-on use of both simple and complex climate models to build understanding of the processes that control the planetary energy budget.

The course makes extensive use of Python code and the IPython notebook for reproducible, self-describing calculations and figures. This repository contains a collection of linked IPython notebooks with lecture notes, examples and assignments. All notebooks are self-describing.

Requirements
---------------
You need a scientific Python distribution available on your system, including numpy, scipy and IPython (version 2.0 or higher is recommended for the latest interactive notebook features).

Usage
------------------
From the main courseware directory, just enter

``ipython notebook``

or

``ipython notebook index.ipynb``

from your favorite terminal.
