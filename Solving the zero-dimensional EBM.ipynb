      "- we wrote down a budget for the energy content of the global climate system\n",
      "- we wrote the OLR in terms of an effective emission temperature $T_e$\n",
      "- The equilibrium emission temperature for Earth is about $T_e \\approx 255$ K\n",
      "- This depends only on energy output from the Sun, and the planetary albedo\n",
      "- We assumed that global energy content is proportional to surface temperature $T_s$\n",
      "- We thus have a single equation in two unknown temperatures:\n",
      "\n",
      "$C \\frac{d T_s}{dt} = (1-\\alpha) Q - \\sigma T_e^4$\n",
      "\n",
      "### Parameterizing the dependence of OLR on surface temperature\n",
      "Later, we will introduce additional physics for column radiative transfer to link $T_s$ and $T_e$.\n",
      "For now, we'll make the **simplest assumption** we can:\n",
      "\n",
      "$ T_e = \\beta T_s$\n",
      "\n",
      "where $\\beta$ is a dimensionless constant. This is a **parameterization** that we introduce into the model for simplicity. We need a value for our **parameter** $\\beta$, which we will get from observations:\n",
      "\n",
      "$T_e = 255$ K\n",
      "\n",
      "$T_s = 288$ K\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus\n",
      "\n",
      "$ \\beta = 255 / 288 = 0.885$\n",

      "### Solving the energy balance model\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a first-order Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) for $T_s$ as a function of time. It is also our very first climate model.\n",
      "\n",
      "To solve it (i.e. see how $T_s$ evolves from some specified initial condition) we have two choices:\n",
      "1. Solve it analytically\n",
      "2. Solve it numerically\n",
      "\n",
      "Option 1 will usually not be possible because the equations will typically be too complex and non-linear. This is why computers are our best friends in the world of climate modeling.\n",
      "\n",
      "HOWEVER it is often useful and instructive to simplify a model down to something that is analytically solvable when possible. Why? Two reasons:\n",
      "1. Analysis will often yield a deeper understanding of the behavior of the system\n",
      "2. Gives us a benchmark against which to test the results of our numerical solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Equilibrium solutions\n",
      "\n",
      "Note that equilibrium surface temperature is \n",
      "\n",
      "$\\bar{T_s} = \\frac{1}{\u03b2} \\bigg( \\frac{(1-\u03b1)Q}{\u03c3}\\bigg)^{\\frac{1}{4}} = 288 K $\n",
      "\n",
      "We are going to linearize the equation for small perturbations away from this equilibrium.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let $T_s = \\bar{T_s} + T_s^\\prime$ and restrict our solution to $T_s^\\prime << \\bar{T_s}$.\n",
      "Note this this is not a big restriction! For example, a 10 degree warming or cooling is just $\\pm$3.4% of the absolute equilibrium temperature.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Linearizing the governing equation: the feedback parameter\n",
      "Now use a first-order Taylor series expansion to write\n",
      "\n",
      "$OLR \\approx \\sigma \\big(\\beta T_s \\big)^4 \\approx \\sigma \\big(\\beta \\bar{T_s} \\big)^4 + \\Big(4 \\sigma \\beta^4 \\bar{T_s}^3 \\Big) T_s^\\prime $\n",
      "\n",
      "and the budget for the perturbation temperature thus becomes\n",
      "\n",
      "$C \\frac{d T_s^\\prime}{d t} = \\lambda T_s^\\prime$\n",
      "\n",
      "where we define\n",
      "\n",
      "$\\lambda = -\\Big(4 \\sigma \\beta^4 \\bar{T_s}^3 \\Big)$\n",
      "\n",
      "Here $\\lambda$ is actually the **feedback parameter** for our system. We will say much more about this later in the course.\n",
      "Putting in our observational values, we get \n",
      "\n",
      "$\\lambda = -3.3$ W m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$\n",
      "\n",
      "This is actually our first estimate of what we will later call the **Planck feedback**, which is found in every climate model. It is the tendency for a warm surface to cool by increased longwave radiation to space. We include the negative sign to indicate that this is a **negative feedback**, which tends to restore the system towards equilibrium. Again, we will return to this later in the course.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Solve the linear ODE\n",
      "\n",
      "Now define\n",

      "\n",
