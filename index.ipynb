    "\n",
    "This document uses the interactive [`Jupyter notebook`](https://jupyter.org) format. The notes can be accessed in several different ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The interactive notebooks are hosted on `github` at https://github.com/brian-rose/ClimateModeling_courseware\n",
    "- The latest versions can be viewed as static web pages [rendered on nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/brian-rose/ClimateModeling_courseware/blob/master/index.ipynb)\n",
    "- A complete snapshot of the notes as of May 2015 (end of spring semester) are [available on Brian's website](http://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/brose/classes/ATM623_Spring2015/Notes/index.html).\n",
    "- Now modified for the current Spring 2017 version of ATM 623\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of these notes make use of the `climlab` package, available at https://github.com/brian-rose/climlab"
